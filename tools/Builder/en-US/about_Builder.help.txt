SYNOPSIS
    Build system DSL based on PowerShell

VERSION
    You are running version 3.1.1024.0 of Builder :)

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Builder is a source code build system based on PowerShell.

INSTALLATION
    The best option (if you are on Windows 10 or similar) is to use the `Install-Package` command from 
    PowerShell.

    # Using Install-Package

    1. `Install-Package Builder`

    2. `ipmo Builder`

    3. `Get-Help about_Builder`, or `Get-Command -Module Builder`.

    4. YOUR WORK HERE IS DONE.


    # Manual portable installation

    If that doesn't work for you, try installing it manually.

    1. Download the latest release (https://get.lizoc.com/builder.zip)[from here]. If you want a specific 
       version, it's something like `https://get.lizoc.com/builder.3.1.1024.0.zip`.

    2. Copy the 'Builder' folder in archive to `Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`.
    So you get `Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Builder\Builder.psd1`, ...

    3. Make sure your PowerShell policy allows running scripts (in an escalated terminal, type in: 
    `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`).

    4. Here is a short script snipplet to automate the steps above:
    ```
    wget https://get.lizoc.com/builder.zip -OutFile $env:TEMP\builder.zip
    Expand-Archive $env:TEMP\builder.zip $env:PSModulePath.Split(';')[0]
    ipmo Builder
    ```
